abstract = {Understanding the effects of laser phase noise on frequency-modulated continuous-wave distance measurements is important in evaluating ranging accuracy. The standard white-frequency-noise assumption is commonly used to predict the ranging performance. However, other noise sources are typically present that can further degrade the heterodyne beat signal and make this assumption invalid. In addition, many ranging systems employ active sweep linearization techniques that can impact the phase noise. Here, we present a phase-noise model for assessing the accuracy of a phase-locked swept laser source.},
