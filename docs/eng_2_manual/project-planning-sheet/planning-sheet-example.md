| I can make a sketch of my project|  what would be the best gear ratio    | review fabrication guidlines. ask for guidance|
| |  | |

## Timeline to accomplish steps outlined above
**Example:**<br/>
* produce drawings of how I think i can make the car work (own time)
* refine drawing (ie. rough sketch) start CAD, upload files to be cut for next class: 2hr (Week 4)
