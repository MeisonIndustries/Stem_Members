# Design Guidelines

## Eng 1: Design and Build<br/>
Understanding how your design choices, your modelling choices and your fabrication choices all come together is critical for a successful project<br/>




## Onshape CAD Guidelines<br/>
 * Ensure document properties are set to standard international measurements SI units
 * Keep your design under 75mm x 75 mm x 75mm
 * Ensure no Errors are present in your documement
 * Ensure no thin walls less than 1.2mm are present 



| Things to check |  YES     |  NO|
|----------|:-------------:|:-----:|
| Document properties are set to mm | [x] |  |
| Volume less than 75mm x 75mm x 75mm |  [x]  | |
| CAD is free of errors| [x] | |
| No thin walls exist| [x] | |

* export your stereolithography file by ensuring the file extension is setr to .stl <br/>
## Cura Slicer Guidelines<br/>

 * Ensure document properties are set to standard international measurements SI units
 * Keep your design under 75mm x 75 mm x 75mm
 * Ensure no Errors are present in your documement
 * Ensure no thin walls less than 1.2mm are present

| What I know |  What I dont know     |  possible actions|
|----------|:-------------:|:-----:|
| I know how to take all the measurements | I am unsure how to make the arms | learn to make cones. do some research before next session|
| I can make a sketch of my project|  How detailed can I make the arms    | review fabrication guidlines. ask for guidance|
| I can model the body and all the connections| Not sure how big the arms should be | review design guidlines|
