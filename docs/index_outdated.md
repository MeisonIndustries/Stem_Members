# Welcome

Welcome to the Saplings STEM camps/course materials. Please find below a guide to the main sections of the website.

## Home
The home section (this section) contains various materials related to the camps, nagivating the materials and other administrative information relating to the Saplings STEM objectives and deliverables:


## Eng 1 : Design and Build

<br/>

(minimun 6 students to run and no greater than 8 students)

Eng 1 is designed for children ages 8-10 introducing them to think critically about the world around them and what it takes to build everyday items. The camp is designed around 16 hours of instruction, split into 2 hour blocks over 8 weeks. The first 3 weeks will be dedicated to completing a grouped guided project. The students will work with a partner as they learn new skills related to tools, software, fabrication and collaboration. Todays world requires a greater level of interaction and learning effective soft skills is just as important as technical abilities to ensure teams performance and maintaining successful relationships as projects evolve.  Eng 1 is designed as an introductory course and the students will interact with the tools and software, but have limited and supervised interaction with the fabrication equipment during the camp.    

## Week 1: 
During the first session students will be welcomed into the space and be introduced to the instructor, each other and become familiar with the space, tools and software that will be used over the next 8 weeks. 

Students will be required to interact with the group and articulate why they want to take part in the camp and their goals or expected outcome after the 8 weeks.


Students will then create an account if they do not already have one and gain access to the portal. All camp information will be available for camp registrants at anytime during the 8 weeks. Students will have access to ONSHAPE a cloud based professional computer aided design[CAD] software that they can used during the 8 weeks outside of the program from any internet connected computer.


Students will be introduced to calipers and different measuring devices. They will work through some examples and applications related to SI and Imperial units. Though our neighbours to the south use Imperial Units and it is widly used in the contruction industry Saplings STEM programs will use Standard Internation units of measurment SI. 


Students will begin to analyse and build their own fidget spinner as the guided project to get them used to the tools and give them a real life exaple of what is required to design and build a product/toy. 

## Week 2:

Students will begin their analysis of the group guided project. 


Students will begin their CAD jouney utilizing measurment tools to represent real world objects into the computer generated landscape. They will learn basic commands within ONSHAPE learning how to set up their documents and work in both 2D and 3D environments. They will begin to understand the different file extension formats and their uses and limitations.


Students will also begin to understand how and where to find resources to help in their CAD jouney. Many electrical and mechanical parts providers have CAD available to allow ease of intrgration into products.

## Week 3:

Students will finalize their design, export an .stl file to the slicer software and prepare their product for print.<br/><br/>
Students will also begin the planning of their self guided project using the skills and tools they learned in the first 3 weeks. Students can decide to work individually or with a partner and will be required to submit a working plan and timeline that will be executed over the next 5 sessions<br/>

[Project Planning Sheet Download](eng_1_manual/project-planning-sheet/Project_Planning_Sheet_Eng_1.odt){:download="Project_Planning_Sheet_Eng_1.odt"}<br/><br/>

The self guided projects will be reviewed with the students to ensure feasibility and cost are reasonable. 

## Week 4:

Students will begin working on their self directed projects and be encouraged to work independently while having access to the resources and instructor. The next few weeks will be utilized to gain greater CAD literacy and gain additional critical thinking skills as they analyze their projects and work towards making it a reality.   

## Weeks 5 & 6:
Students will continue to CAD and be introduced to additional features of ONSHAPE including how to turn 3D objects into projected 2D drawings  

## Week 7:
Students will finalize their projects saving their work and necessary files for the projects to be fabricated and ready to post process on the last class.

## Week 8:
Students will wrap up their projects saving their work and necessary files to the cloud. They will also post process their parts and complete a camp reflection and debrief.

## Eng 2: Mechanical Systems
<br/>

(minimun 6 students to run and no greater than 8 students)

Eng 2 is designed for children ages 10+ introducing them to think critically about the world around them and what it takes to build everyday items. The camp is designed around 16 hours of intruction, split into 2 hour blocks over 8 weeks. The first 3 weeks will be dedicated to completing an partnered guided project. The students will work with a partner as they learn new skills related to tools, software, fabrication and collaboration. Todays world requires a greater level of interaction and learning effective soft skills is just as important as technical abilities to ensure teams performance and maintaining successful relationships as projects evolve. Eng 2 is designed as an introductory course and the students will interact with the tools and software, but have limited and supervised interaction with the fabrication equipment during the camp depending on the childs ability.    

## Week 1: 
During the first session students will be welcomed into the space and be introduced to the instructor, each other and become familiar with the space, tools and software that will be used over the next 8 weeks. 

Students will be required to interact with the group and articulate why they want to take part in the camp and their goals or expected outcome after the 8 weeks.


Create an account and gain access to the portal. All camp information will be available for camp registrants at anytime during the 8 weeks. Students will have access to ONSHAPE a cloud based professional computer aided design[CAD] software that they can used during the 8 weeks outside of the program from any internet connected computer.


Students will be introduced to calipers and different measuring devices. They will work through some examples and applications related to SI and Imperial units. Though our neighbours to the south use Imperial Units and it is widly used in the contruction industry Saplings STEM programs will use Standard Internation units of measurment SI. 


Students will begin to analyse and build their own geared mechanical catapult as the guided project to get them used to the tools and allow them to not just visualize mechanism, but built interacting parts that complete a specific task.

## Week 2:

Students will begin their analysis of the ipartnered guided project. 


Students will begin their CAD jouney utilizing measurment tools to represent real world objects into the computer generated landscape. They will learn basic commands within ONSHAPE learning how to set up their documents and work in both 2D and 3D environments. They will begin to understand the different file extension formats and their uses and limitations.


Students will also begin to understand how and where to find resources to help in their CAD jouney. Lots of electrical and mechanical systems have CAD available to allow ease of intrgration of suppliers parts into products.

## Week 3:
