## Partnered Project<br/>
Students will have the opportunity to complete as many lessons as they want during the remaining 5 weeks. In addittion they will learn basic electronic problem solving and get introduced to more advanced electronic testing equipment. If the student wants a challenge and feels they can bring a few lessons together with some additional mechanical skills to reate something of their own they will be encouraged and supported to do so.
