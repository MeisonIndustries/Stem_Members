# USING ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT

There are plenty of tasks out there that require you to be fast and efficient. 
<br /> Sports are a prime example, maybe cleaning your room, but not all tasks are about how fast you can accomplish it. <br /> <br />Take your time when using electrical equipment. 

It also makes a world of difference when working in groups if you know where things are when you need it. Being a good steward of tools and equipment means putting things back the way you found them makes everyones life easier. <br /><br /> Tools and equipment break, its an unfortunate fact of life and not something to be worried about. If a piece of equipment is not working how ypu think it should  just let the instructor know and it will be inspected and/or replaced.

## Safety always comes first!<br /> <br /> Personal Protective Equipment PPE must be used with specific tools and you must always have PPE on when entering the fabrication area or working with electronics
