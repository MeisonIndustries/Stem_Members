# SAFE CUTTING PRACTICES

## Do I have the proper PPE on?
When using sharp or rotating blades always ensure you have cut resistant gloves and eye protection

## Am I cutting in a safe environment?
Different jobs require different angles and tools. Ensure you are not going to hurt yourself or others while cutting. Use a vise or table clamp if needed.

## What direction am I cutting?
Always ensure what your cutting is secure. Always cut away from yourself (ie.pushing a blade). Ensure if you have a spinning blade that the blade is spoinning away from you and that you are spraying any removed debris into a shield or wall.
