# CHOOSING THE RIGHT ELECTRICAL Equipment

**Electrical systems are dangerous and its important to ensure you work safely.**

## Safety Best Practices

Ask yourself the following questions:

1) Is the device/power supply turned off and/or unplugged?<br/><br/>
2) Do I have eye protection on?<br/><br/>
3) Do I understand what I want to test and why?<br/><br/>
4) Am I using the right equipment?<br/><br/>

Although the urge is there to start poking and proding. It is easy to create a short circuit and destroy your electronics board.
