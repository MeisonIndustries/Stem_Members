# Project Planning Sheet

## Title of Project:
**Example: Captain Octopi!**
## Description of project:
**Example:**<br/>

* I want to build my own lego character that has articulating octopus arms 
* I brought in a lego character that i will use as a reference  


## Outline steps needed to accomplish the above description:
**Example:**<br/>

* I will use the caliper to take outside measurements of the key dimensions:
  * Diameter of head : 8mm
  * Height of head:
  * Diameter of arm joint connection:
  * Length of arm joint connection:
  * Height of body:
  * Width of body:
  * Depth of body:
  * Recesses depth of arm joint:
  * Recess diameter of arm joiunt:
  * Recesses depth of feet to connect to lego blocks:
  * Recess diameter of feet to connect to lego blocks:
* Arms will be modelled with a 45 degree bend
* Body will be modelled as multiple joined primary shapes : cylinder and rectangles
* I will CAD 2 seperate parts: 1 arm and the body. I want to print 8 identicle arms that will connect to the cylinder of the body

## What skills do I have to complete the project and what skills don't I know how to do?
**Example:** <br/>

| What I know |  What I dont know     |  possible actions|
|----------|:-------------:|:-----:|
| I know how to take all the measurements | I am unsure how to make the arms | learn to make cones. do some research before next session|
| I can make a sketch of my project|  How detailed can I make the arms    | review fabrication guidlines. ask for guidance|
| I can model the body and all the connections| Not sure how big the arms should be | review design guidlines|

## Timeline to accomplish steps outlined above
**Example:**<br/>

* Taking all measurements and produce drawing (ie. rough sketch) do a design review : 2hr (Week 4)
* Create body of Captain octopi and do a CAD review: 2 Hr (Week 5)
* Create the CAD for the arms and do a cad review: 2 Hrs (Week 6)
* Check CAD in slicer software : Check print time meets fabrication requirements finalize submission and submit for fabrication 2 Hrs( Week 7) 
* Post process the parts, save any files, group check in review and future thoughts ( Week 8)
