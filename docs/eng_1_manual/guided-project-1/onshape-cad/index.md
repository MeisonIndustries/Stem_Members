## Welcome Camp Members!


**Let the journey begin**<br/><br/>
External Resources are available for you to maximize your learning and get the most out of your CAD journey. <br/>

The following links provide in-depth examples for you to work through at your own pace. Try not to get overwhelmed design and CAD is meant to be enjoyable and fumbling through and struggling is all part of the growth mindset.<br/>
